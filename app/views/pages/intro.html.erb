<h2>Programming for kids?</h2>

<section>
  <p>
    I believe that in today's world there are many reasons why children should pick up programming early on. In an environment increasingly dominated by computers, accompanying skills should be taught to children for the same reason we teach them languages, mathematics or geography. It is our responsibility to equip children with the knowledge necessary to understand our world and to have a host of options in it and I believe that programming can play an integral part in this.

    Children today are surrounded by software from their game consoles, over their music players to their mobile phones. By teaching them how to program, we can show them how to become an active and defining part of this new world we live in. Programming is a creative and challenging occupation with immediate feedback, which is highly suited to satisfy children's natural curiosity.
